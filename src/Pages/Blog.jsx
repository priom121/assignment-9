You want the wedding of your dreams without compromise. A ceremony expressing the heart. Food which is delicious and tempts seconds. Styling where guests go wow. A room which allows you to celebrate.

At Tailrace Weddings we want to capture your dream and remove the stress so you can truly enjoy the day with your guests and family.

We don’t want you to wait for information, to compromise your dream, to apologise to family and friends for the quality of ceremony music or the food not being delicious.

You need one partner who can work with you to bring your dream to life and have everyone talking about the amazing wedding you planned and dreamed of.

At Tailrace we are passionate about creating beautiful, stress free events. We’ve done over 400 weddings and know that planning a wedding doesn’t have to be a stressful experience.

Sharon and Nicole are here to help guide you through the process and help you figure out what you want your wedding day to be.!

<p>
Birthdays are a very special day for everyone who celebrates it. Firstly, it makes the person feel loved when their close one does special things for them. Being loved is one of the most special feelings in the world.

Secondly, it makes the person mature. We all wait for our birthday every day as we get older and gain a sense of maturity every year. Our birthday marks the occasion for the very same thing. Moreover, it helps you gain special privileges as well.

After that, birthdays are also an eye-opener for many as they feel gratitude. When you see many people going out of their way to make you feel special, you feel gratitude for being blessed with so many things.

Most importantly, birthdays call for celebration. It is one day where we get to see all our loved ones in one place. No one can make an excuse and you get to spend time with everyone you love under one roof, it is nothing sort of magical.
